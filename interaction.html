<h1>Diversity is valuable, but is it fashionable?</h1>
<h2>John Locke Essay Competition - High Commendation</h2>
<p>John Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding theorized that all human beings start as a blank slate, or “tabula rasa”. At the very beginning, we have no understanding of the world, and as we grow, we learn to form opinions, love, and hate. Somewhere in that process of learning, children subconsciously learn and imitate the subtleties in the actions the adults do, and separate themselves by their features— their race, gender, or economic status. Separation between the groups leads to unknowns between the groups, and unknowns between the groups lead to the fear these groups have of one another, and at some point, for some people, that fear turns into hate.</p>
<p>Naturally, to steer society away from becoming groups, different only by race or ethnicity, yet separated a world apart, as it has in the past, we as a collective group must do the opposite of separation: integration. And naturally, integration brings diversity.</p>
<p>In the current political context, “diversity” is nothing more than a buzzword— it almost always refers to just having more ethnicities or genders in the room. It’s a goal for some, an attack for others. “Diversity, equity, and inclusion”, or DEI, has become another insult for politicians, internet trolls, or racists to use as someone who is perceived as an “affirmative action” hire.</p> 
<p>While diversity has become a political buzzword, if we intentionally implement diversity thoughtfully rather than just for show, particularly by emphasizing socio-economic diversity rather than racial diversity in fields that are needed, then diversity becomes invaluable to us as a society. </p>
<p>intentionally implementing diversity is valuable, as it brings two primary benefits: enhancing social mobility for marginalized groups and fostering interactions with people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. But to achieve those benefits, we must choose what types of “diversity” institutions will implement, and where we will implement them. Racial diversity is the current norm, but it is less effective than socio-economic diversity in bringing out the two benefits; thus, it should only be used in fields where there are specific benefits to racial diversity. In other fields, socio-economic diversity should be widespread instead.</p>


<p>Education has long been a battleground for and against diversity, and racial affirmative action should be eliminated from higher education, and institutions should place more emphasis on granting those with lower socio-economic status more spots (a large portion of which includes disadvantaged people of color)
<p>The United States higher education system has gone from Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, arguing that race can be a factor but quotas cannot be made, to the famous Gratz v. Bollinger, which cemented the idea that affirmative action is allowed and still can be considered. The original intent of affirmative action and other “diversity” initiatives was to help balance the racial inequality against people of color, especially African-Americans, in American society in the 1960s. As clashes on affirmative action occurred in the 60s and 70s, leading to Regents v. Bakke, in which Justice Powell argued that it was in colleges’ interest to have a diverse student body.</p>
<p>Studies back up Powell’s argument: a 2013 study shows that those who go to a more racially diverse college tend to have higher incomes, and it argues that it is because the experience of diversity allows a student to be more productive and comfortable in a global setting. However, an inherent bias must be noted. According to a diversity study on universities in the United States, four of the top five racially diverse colleges are private), and so naturally, schools with more funds tend to give disadvantaged minorities scholarships in a way that universities with less funds cannot, and because the wealthier schools have a higher-quality education (among other things), their alumni will have higher incomes. Thus, the pattern between attending racially diverse colleges and having a higher income is a correlation, and less of a causation.</p>
<p>Critics of racial affirmative action argue that admissions should fully disregard race and put more emphasis on merit in fields such as healthcare. Black people often are matriculated into medical schools with lower MCAT scores compared to Asian and White people: in the 2024-25 school year, Black people matriculated at an average MCAT score of 505.9 while Asian and White people matriculated at an average of 513.9 and 511.2. Economic background plays a big role in this disparity. As the MCAT is a decently strong indicator of medical school performance, it means that they would do worse in medical school and also in their profession, even if they pass the USMLE (United States Medical Licensing Exam) In an occupation that concerns life and death, the race of an applicant should not matter, and only performance should count.</p>
<p>However, there are some merits to having racial diversity, even after looking past the idea of having different cultural perspectives. Having racial concordance in hospitals, in which patients and their healthcare providers have the same race, is very helpful: on average, a 10% increase in the number of county-level Black primary care physicians (PCP) has been associated with a 31-day higher life expectancy, standardized for age, for Black individuals. Furthermore, a study on births in Florida from 1992 to 2015 shows that newborn-physician racial concordance leads to a significant improvement in mortality for Black infants. In short, admissions disregarding race would lead to a more homogeneous healthcare provider population, leading to a decrease in racial concordance and lower quality healthcare, especially for people of color, proving even more that diversity is invaluable.</p>
<p>Almost 50 years on from Bakke, the racial tensions and issues that spurred affirmative action still leave their scars on America today. Yet, today, it is not the race that divides us most. It is our wealth. Research shows that while there most definitely is an education disparity between the races, much of that has to do with the economic status of the families rather than the race. So, if the intended benefits of affirmative action are to be properly implemented— that is, to balance out inequality—  then it would make more sense to pay more attention to socio-economic diversity. While racial diversity is somewhat meritable in healthcare, the same cannot be said for other professions, such as law. There is a lot less evidence for a concept similar to racial concordance in law.</p>
<p>Similar to the MCAT, Black test-takers have an average lower score on the LSAT, 141.70, compared to Asian and White people at 152.85 and 153.18 in the 2017-18 school year. Law is a very important field where people’s entire livelihood depends on the success or failure of a trial, and therefore their lawyer, so having racial diversity in law schools makes less sense. In these fields, instead of affirmative action creating diversity, governments should instead be providing equity. Supporting elementary and secondary education in lower-income areas at the grassroots level will allow more marginalized people, of all races, to grow and have the chance to thrive in undergraduate and graduate education later on. We should not be tilting the bar to achieve diversity, instead, we should be giving people the opportunity to achieve that bar. One way to provide equity would be to grant more scholarships for those with lower socio-economic backgrounds</p>
<p>We have to choose the “correct” type of diversity. While racial diversity could be important, if the two biggest benefits of diversity, fostering different perspectives and providing equity, are to be utilized, then workplaces and academic institutions should not consider race, but economic and cultural background, and economic diversity is undeniably important. Studies have shown that lower-income students are more successful in economically diverse schools, and so having economically diverse institutions grants many lower-income students upward social mobility. Educational institutions shying away from economic diversity means that communities would inevitably become trapped in a rigid caste system, with little to no escape. Economic diversity also brings more varied perspectives. Upper-class Black Americans and upper-class White Americans will have more in common with each other than Americans struggling with financial issues, and admitting people from the two backgrounds in workplaces and schools will increase the number of perspectives people encounter.</p> 
<p>In conclusion, diversity is valuable, but only if it is done correctly. Racial diversity should only be used in fields where there are tangible benefits: for example, racial concordance in the medical field merits racial affirmative action in medical schools, while the lack of a similar phenomenon in law warrants law schools not to take in race as a factor. Furthermore, if not racial diversity, then economic and cultural diversity: economic diversity is what grants social mobility, and sheds more insight into people’s beliefs and backgrounds than race does. It is when these efforts are being made, and not shallow promises to bring diversity and inclusion just so companies and schools can say they did, that diversity will truly be worthwhile to everybody.</p>
<p>Instead of simply lifting people of one race up, lift everybody who needs help: recognize the opportunities that are given to those with a better economic status and provide opportunities to those who don’t. Realize that diversity is not a box to check: it is there for equity and equality. If we focus on opportunity rather than identity, recognize our real differences, not just our physical characteristics, then, and only then, will diversity be valuable in bringing societal harmony and people together. </p>
